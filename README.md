# Analyzing Aircraft Landing Patterns and Operational Efficiency using Machine Learning

This is a 4-week academic aerospace project analyzing air traffic landing data from San Francisco International Airport using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and modeling
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models
- `docs/`: Additional documentation

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Place the "Air Traffic Landings" dataset from Kaggle in the `data/` folder
3. Run the scripts in order: `data_loading.py`, `data_cleaning.py`, `exploratory_analysis.py`, `model_training.py`, `predictions.py`

## Pipeline
1. Load and clean data
2. Explore and visualize key patterns
3. Perform statistical or ML-based trend analysis
4. Predict landing volume or detect anomalies
5. Generate final plots and report-ready insights
